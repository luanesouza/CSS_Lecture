# CSS_Lecture

In this repo you will find 2 other files.
1. An index.html file. This where all the content you see on the browser lives. You will make very little changes to this file. The major focus here is to play around in the style.css file.
2. A style.css file. This is our playground for today. You will be able to make your browser look however you want by changing things in this file.

_Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the current content in both files. Feel free to google any new syntax you see._
