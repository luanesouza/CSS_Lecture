# CSS_Lecture

In this repo you will find 2 other files.
1. An index.html file. This where all the content you see on the browser lives. You will make very little changes to this file. The major focus here is to play around in the style.css file.
2. A style.css file. This is our playground for today. You will be able to make your browser look however you want by changing things in this file.

_Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the current content in both files. Feel free to google any new syntax you see._

# Rules when styling with CSS

1. We need to make sure our websites can be easily used by screen readers. We will have the least amount of `div` as possible. Instead, we will use tags like `<section>`, `<main>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<form>`, `<table>`, and `<article>` that clearly defines its content.

2. We will use `em`,  `rem` or `percentage` to determine the size of text and images. This will make our apps responsive to different screen sizes.

3. Your browser will not automatically refresh when you make changes to the files. You will need to refresh it manually.

4. You can open an html file by cd-ing into this repo from the terminal and typing `open index.html`. This should open the file on your browser of choice.
The alternative to that is to right click the file `index.html` and select `Copy Full Path`. Then open your browser and past the path on the url bar.

5. We will be talking more about flex vs grid in class. In the meantime, please reference https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ for flexbox, and https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/ for grid.
